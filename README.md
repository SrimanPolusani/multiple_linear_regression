<h1>multiple_linear_regression</h1>
<p>This project is built for businesses to make the decision-making process easier. This machine learning project is built from scratch using Numpy for calculations and Matplotlib for data visualization. It can take multiple features as data input. The 'multiple_linear_regressor' object can find cost, compute the gradient, perform gradient descent, visualize the accuracy of the model and can also be used for making predictions from the final model.</p>
